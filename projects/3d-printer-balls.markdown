I cut some tennis balls in half and put them under the feet. Kinda looks funny but it works much better than washing machine dampers.

Previously the floor would shake when printing at full tilt with just one. Now with two printers running at the same time the shaking is all but gone.

After 3 months, they haven't budged. No problem whatsoever. Not sure how this would fair with a P1 or Mini. It should be fine.

Be careful cutting the balls. I used a bandsaw which made it easy but it is possible with a utility knife.
