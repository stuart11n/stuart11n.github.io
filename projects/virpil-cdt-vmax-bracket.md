- Bolts together, needs no support. Print with 5 or 6 walls. Infill 15%. PLA is fine.
- Unbolt the bottom plate on the throttle, reuse th same bolts to attach it to the bracket (leave the bottom plate on) 

- as-is requires 11 x M3 bolts with heatset nuts. Easily modified to use straight through nuts and bolts though
- 4 x M6 profile nuts
- 4 x M6 30mm hex socket bolts to join the main bracket assemblies
- 2 x M6 30mm hex socket bolts to attach to rig
- 2 x M6 20mm hex socket bolts to attach to rig
