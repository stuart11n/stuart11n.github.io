- Bolts together, needs no support. Print with 5 or 6 walls. Infill 15%. PLA is fine.
- Unbolt the bottom plate on the throttle, reuse th same bolts to attach it to the bracket (leave the bottom plate on) 
- It has a cable channel running through

- 11 x M3 10mm bolts with heatset nuts
- 4 x M6 profile nuts
- 4 x M6 30mm hex socket bolts to join the main bracket assemblies
- 2 x M6 30mm hex socket bolts to attach to rig
- 2 x M6 20mm hex socket bolts to attach to rig 

It was built to use what I had on hand. Easily modifiable to use straight through nuts and bolts instead of heatset and it could also be tweaked to use on M6 30mm.

The NO ACCESS hatch is there to cover an accessory mount point, I had a touchpad platform there at one point. It could be blanked off completely.
