- Bolts together, needs no support. Print with 5 or 6 walls. Infill 15%. PLA is fine.
- Unbolt the bottom plate on the throttle, reuse the same bolts to attach it to the bracket (leave the bottom plate on) 
- It has a channel for the USB cable
- It was built to use what I had on hand. Easily modifiable to use straight through nuts and bolts instead of heatset nuts and it could also be tweaked to use on M6 30mm.
- The NO ACCESS hatch is there to cover an accessory mount point, I had a touchpad platform attached at one point. It could be blanked off completely.
