I no longer use this - instead I joined two [Funky-coder Plus'](funky-coder-plus) together to make the [Funky-coder Quattro](funky-coder-quattro) 

### Features

- Two 7-way funky switches that appears as a 4-way POV HAT + push button + encoder 
- Four dual encoders with push button
- Three toggles 
- USB-C

Inputs can be mapped in-game as normal HID device buttons.

The smaller Funky-coder is available in my [Etsy Shop](https://s16nengineering.etsy.com)
