Ultimate encoder button box. I no longer use this because I prefer the simpler interface of the Funky-coder in VR.

### Features

- Two 7-way funky switches that appears as a 4-way POV HAT + push button + encoder 
- Four dual encoders with push button
- Three toggles 
- USB-C

Inputs can be mapped in-game as normal HID device buttons.

The smaller Funky-coder is available in my [Etsy Shop](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1836479954/)
