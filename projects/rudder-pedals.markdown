title: Rudder Pedals Mk. 7
---

I designed these rudder pedals to be bolted to the underside of a racing rig pedal plate. 

### Features

- 3D printed, with 8mm linear rod and bearings and RC shocks
- toe brakes and rudder control
- AS5600 magnetic position sensors on all three axis 
- adjustable pedal angle
- USB-C

### Possible future enhancements

- quick release tension for rotary flight
- experiment with a stepper motor for providing the centering force, replacing the springs. This could also provide force feedback
- further build simplification

### Previous Iterations

#### Mk. 6

Evolution of Mk. 4, but with separate toe brakes. As soon as I finished them, I realized my mistake with Mk. 5...

#### Mk. 5

Really nice, but hard to use the toe brakes. Angles are all wrong.

A video of the pedals installed and working:

#### Mk. 4

I hacked brakes onto Mk. 3 using load cells (pictured) and although they work they don't have good feel leading to the redesign.

#### Mk. 3

The rudder control works really well, but I didn't include brakes.

#### Mk. 2

Felt awful.
