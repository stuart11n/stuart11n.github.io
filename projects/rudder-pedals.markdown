title: Rudder Pedals Mk. 8
---

I designed these rudder pedals to be bolted to the underside of a racing rig pedal plate.

Mk .8 is simpler and cheaper to build and has to potential for variable/motorized centering force.


### Features

- 3D printed, with 8mm linear rod and bearings
- toe brakes and rudder control
- AS5600 magnetic position sensors on all three axis 
- adjustable pedal angle
- easy install/removal, two bolts and it slides out
- USB-C

### Possible enhancements

- electro-mechanical release of centering force for rotary flight
- experiment with a stepper motor for providing the centering force. This could also provide force feedback

### Previous Iterations

#### Mk. 1

Nope.

#### Mk. 2

These felt awful...

#### Mk. 3

The rudder control works really well, but I didn't include brakes.

#### Mk. 4

I hacked brakes onto Mk. 3 using load cells (pictured) and although they work they don't have very good feel.

#### Mk. 5

Really nice, felt like I was getting somewhere but hard to use the toe brakes and a bit heavy to use.

A video of the pedals installed and working:

#### Mk. 6

Evolution of Mk. 4, but with separate toe brakes. Immediately after I finished them, I realized my mistake with Mk. 5...

#### Mk. 7

Excellent pedals! Did not center very well, also impossible to release the centering force.
