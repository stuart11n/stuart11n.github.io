Twin dual encoders and a funky switch with 4 modes (layers). For use with aviation sim and simracing. Great for VR!

### Features

- 2 x dual encoders with push button
- 1 x funkyswitch with encoder, push button and 4-way POV
- 4-way mode switch remaps the above providing 8 dual encoders and 4 funky switches in one unit
- Dimensions: Approx. 70mm x 60mm x 32mm

Inputs can be mapped in game as a normal HID device so it's compatible with all games, and tools such as SPAD.next and Axis And Ohs.
