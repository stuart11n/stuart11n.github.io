I wanted a set of trim wheels, I could not find anything suitable so I created the Trim Deck. It's the same size as the Virpil CDT-VMAX throttle so I could use [this mounting bracket](./virpil-cdt-vmax-bracket).

# Trim Wheels

The elevator uses an optical encoder with 360 pulses per revolution. This provides a very smooth motion. The rudder and aileron use mechanical encoders with 20 detents.

The elevator wheel protrudes out of the bottom of the case.

# Fuel Tank Selection

The two red knobs are for fuel tank selection. They are 6-way rotary switches so you can map a twin engine very nicely or a single and have a spare for fuel valve, or use them for something else entirely.

Mapping tank selection can be tricky, each plane may require different mapping.  I use it on the Black Box Dukes and Blackbird 310R, Flying Iron warbirds. It takes a while to set up each plane but it's worth it. 

I have used SPAD.next to do this, per plane, and it works well. MobiFlight should also be able to manage it but I have no experience with it. I have not tried mapping directly in-game.

# Push Buttons

![3](../assets/trim-deck/3.png){: .center-image }

Four general purpose momentary push buttons, single color and constantly illuminated.  

# Toggles

![4](../assets/trim-deck/4.png){: .center-image }

Six general purpose chrome toggles (ON)-OFF-(ON). I use momentary action toggle so that the game state doesn't matter;  whether the navigation lights in the game are on or off, a push up always turns them on and push down turns them off. However, if you prefer regular latching ON-OFF-ON action, or even ON-OFF, that is not a problem, just order different units.

# Mounting

The case does not come with any mounting holes, in my application I reuse the existing bolts to attach it to my mounting bracket. Modify the case or bottom plate as needed. Or use the included bottom plate that fixes directly onto my [mounting bracket](./virpil-cdt-vmax-bracket).

# Software

SPAD.next or Mobiflight are needed to map fuel tanks and to alter the speed of trim adjustment.
