This unit is designed for controlling trim surfaces and other trimmable aircraft inputs such as cowl flaps, mixture. 

It features three wheel input and a lever. The lever output is an axis and the wheels output as both axis and buttons. 

The intention is to map the large wheel to elevator trim, the two middle wheels mapped to aileron trim and rudder trim, leaving the lever for cowl flaps for example. But this is not fixed, they can all mapped to your prefered inputs.

Bear in mind that the ability to map inputs depends on the simulator. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator supports axis inputs for elevator trim and cowl flaps but not for rudder and aileron trim. There are two ways to solve this:

1. RECOMMENDED: use an external tool such as SPAD.next, Axis and Ohs or Mobiflight to convert the axis outputs into simconnect commands. I can provide the snippets to do this. 
2. the unit also outputs button presses for each wheel direction, so map those outputs to rudder trim inc/dec and aileron inc/dec etc. However this option is not very satisfying and the making changes is very slow (in MSFS). 

For other simulators, please check whether it can map an axis for your desired control, be that rudder trim, aileron trim or something else. 

Note: these are axis. So much like other physical controls, like throttle, RPM, mixture, performing a reset  cannot reset the physical position.
