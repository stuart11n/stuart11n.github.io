[V1](virpil-cdt-vmax-bracket-v1.md) worked fine but I wanted more height, it could have been 3D printed (my [WarBRD QR](warbrd-qr.markdown)  is as tall) but I want to try something new.

- For 40-series profile

- The 4040 can pass through the lower bracket making it somewhat height adjustable (limited by distance to floor)

- Prints with no support

- Print with strength profile. 5 or 6 walls. PLA is fine. Don't skimp on filament, it needs to be rigid.

- Two lower brackets included, depending on rig attachment point

- Download on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1309679-virpil-cdt-vmax-profile-bracket)
