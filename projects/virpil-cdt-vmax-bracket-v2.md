[V1](virpil-cdt-vmax-bracket-v1.md) worked fine but I wanted more height, it could have been 3D printed (my [WarBRD QR](warbrd-qr.markdown)  is around the same height) but I want to try something new.

- For 40-series profile

- The 4040 can pass through the lower bracket making it somewhat height adjustable (limited by distance to floor)

- Print with strength profile. 5 or 6 walls. PLA is fine. Don't skimp on filament, it needs to be rigid

- Two lower brackets variants included, use depending on rig attachment point as illustrated in the rendering

- Tolerances are **tight** on the 4040 interfaces, especially the top socket. Print `calibration.stl` before committing to the whole thing and adjust accordingly. It prints correctly with no adjustment on my BBL A1

## Parts needed

- 8 x M6 profile T-nuts (spring loaded is a must on the lower bracket to rig bolts)

- 4 x M6 20mm hex socket bolts 
- 4 x M6 25mm hex socket bolts 
- 4040 profile - I used 280mm
