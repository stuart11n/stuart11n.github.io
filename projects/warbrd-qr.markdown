This is a Quick Release mounting stalk for the Virpil WarBRD-D.

![](/assets/wbqr/wbqr1.jpg){: .center-image }

It comprises:

- the bottom QR socket that bolts to the 4080 cross-member 
- the stalk which plugs into the QR socket, and has a top-plate onto which the flight stick base is bolted

The QR unit has a connection that carries the USB signal.

The top-plate (the bottom of the flightstick base) is positioned maximum 20cm above the cross-member. The minimum is 5cm, which would allow the use of a regular flight stick extension. Specify the desired stalk height when ordering. 

The QR mount sits on the 4080 cross-member, it has a channel to route the USB cable across the profile back under the seat. The position of the cross-member should allow for mounting vertically, per the photos, with the flightstick mounted *centrally*.

Note: if your seat is on rails, it's position will be restricted when the stalk is attached.  

If you have specific mounting requirements, or questions, let me know; the design has some leeway. If you have a different base, given the dimensions and mounting points, an appropriate top-plate could be made. 

A USB cable is included, connecting to the flight stick base (Virpil GX12-4L) and on the rig end, USB-A to your USB hub.

Includes mounting hardware for 4080 profile.

February 2025 - the top-plate was redesigned to make it more easily adaptable to other bases and for improved strength and less flex.
